<p>The purpose of this file is to help you set up a local copy of
	the language database for testing changes. This is not a
	general-purpose web app, so we mainly have our own set-up in mind.</p>
<p>Software required &mdash; versions are ones which are currently
	used somewhere:</p>
<ul>
	<li>MySQL (5.5.24)</li>
	<li>Apache with <tt>mod_rewrite</tt> enabled (2.2.22)
	</li>
	<li>PHP (5.3.10)</li>
</ul>

</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Copy your files to the webroot of the server</li>
	<li>Import the schema:</li>
	<dd>
		The schema is in this file: <a href="files/samoan-schema.sql">samoan-schema.sql</a>.
		You may also want to download a dump of the database if you plan on
		working with definitions.
	</dd>
	<li>Make your config.php:</li>
	<dd>
		Fill in the database section in the <a href="files/config.php.txt">blank
			configuration file</a>, and copy it to
		<tt>api/config.php</tt>
		.
	</dd>
	<li>Set up a <tt>.htaccess</tt> file in the webroot:
		<dd>
			If you have put the scripts in the
			<tt>/sm</tt>
			folder, and want to access them as
			<tt>/samoan</tt>
			, then <a href="files/example.htaccess.txt">this example</a> will do
			it.
		</dd>
		<dd>
			Make sure you set
			<tt>AllowOverride All</tt>
			for the directory so that the
			<tt>.htaccess</tt>
			file will be read.
		</dd>
		<dd>You may need to change your cofiguration to load mod_rewrite,
			if your distribution does not load it by default.</dd>
	</li>
